# Calendar-Pro
This is a side project that i am working on. "Calendar Pro" is an Electronic Agenda, that let's you add, delete or update events in your everyday schedule. For now, only the front end is in development, but soon there will be node.js files to use as back end APIs to save and retrieve data from a Mongo Database.
